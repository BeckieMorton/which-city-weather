# which-city-weather

Creating a new weather app to improve on the first one I bult in JavaScript. This time I am incorporating React and going to play around with some libraries, animation and give the user the choice to choose the city they want the weather for.

Learning goals for this application

- I want to know how to make a search bar that auto completes using a list. for searching the cities??? I need to research how to do this

- I would love to use a map that when you hover over it it chooses the city, that would be cool!

- TO DO look up the following: React-map-gl (mapbox) for the city map, react-simple-maps (svg) for the country map
